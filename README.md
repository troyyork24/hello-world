  Hello, my name is Troy York out of Wisconsin! I am in my introduction to devolping. I think technology is the future so coding is the fundamentals of tech. Coding seems like it's a very versatile skill because you can code apps, websites, CURRENCY, toys, and just about everything else. This is fun to me so having a job doing it seems like i'm stealing money. Starting to develop with SwiftUI and plan to expand to any language.
  
  Thank you for visiting my GIT (is that the termology here?)
